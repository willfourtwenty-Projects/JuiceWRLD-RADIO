And we live<br><br>
And we recording<br>
And it's lean on deck, y'know?<br>
Purple Rain<br>
Okay, so<br>
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night<br>
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night<br>
I was rocking off-white, tryna have a fun time<br>
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time<br>
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine<br>
Swervo told me stop poppin' them xannies 'fore I flatline<br>
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine<br>
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine<br>
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine<br>
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine<br>
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine<br>
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine<br>
But in the meantime<br>
Bitch, it's lean time<br>
Pop a bean time 'cause it ain't killing me<br>
My lil' bro keep a .40, they thought his ass was security<br>
Too busy making money, to worry 'bout making memories<br>
But in the meantime, bitch, it's green time<br>
Maybe lean time, outta energy<br>
My momma told me, stop the painkillers<br>
Them shits is killing me, I'ma be fine<br>

I'ma be fine<br>
I'ma be fine<br>
I'ma be fine<br>
They know my name, oh wait<br>
Put it in her mouth just like Colgate<br>
Get outta line and you get punched in your face<br>
Shouldn't have been around here in the first place<br>
Now you got a black eye<br>
I got mob ties, I've got gang ties<br>
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide<br>
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five<br>
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line<br>
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime<br>
I remember eating ramen, with a Glock .9<br>
I remember when she left me for the next guy<br>
Now she calling me her next guy<br>

I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine<br>

I sit down<br>
I can't stand it anymore<br>
Can't stand it anymore<br>

So I woke up dreaming<br>
And fiending for more<br>
For more<br>

One cup, I need four more, hey<br>
