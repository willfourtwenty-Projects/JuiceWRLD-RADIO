Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder<br><br>
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder<br>
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?<br>
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure<br>
Lean with me, pop with me<br>
Get high with me if you rock with me<br>
Smoke with me, drink with me<br>
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys<br>
Lean with me, pop with me<br>
Get high with me if you rock with me<br>
Smoke with me, drink with me<br>
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys<br>
Told her if I die, yeah, I'ma die young<br>
Every day I've been getting fucked up<br>
Finally know the difference between love and drugs<br>
Shawty tell me I should really sober up<br>
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real<br>
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills<br>
I'm looking for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it<br>
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timing<br>
I know I'm not right<br>
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong<br>
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high<br>
But that's where I belong, where I belong<br>
Lean with me, pop with me<br>
Get high with me if you rock with me<br>
Smoke with me, drink with me<br>
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys<br>
Lean with me, pop with me<br>
Get high with me if you rock with me<br>
Smoke with me, drink with me<br>
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys<br>
Eyes red, no Visine<br>
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen<br>
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean<br>
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean<br>
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh<br>
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me<br>
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?<br>
I'on even wanna think about that right now<br>
Let's get too high, reach a new height<br>
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time<br>
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life<br>
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right<br>
Lean with me, pop with me<br>
Get high with me if you rock with me<br>
Smoke with me, drink with me<br>
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys<br>
Lean with me, pop with me<br>
Get high with me if you rock with me<br>
Smoke with me, drink with me<br>
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad kidneys)<br>
