No, no, no, no<br><br>
I still see your shadows in my room<br>
Can't take back the love that I gave you<br>
It's to the point where I love and I hate you<br>
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you (oh)<br>
Easier said than done<br>
I thought you were the one<br>
Listening to my heart instead of my head<br>
You found another one, but<br>
I am the better one<br>
I won't let you forget me<br>

I won't let you forget me<br>
You left me falling and landing inside my grave<br>
I know that you want me dead<br>
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay<br>
I know it's all in my head<br>
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing<br>
Thinking of you in my bed<br>
You were my everything<br>
Thoughts of a wedding ring<br>
Now I'm just better off dead<br>
I'll do it over again<br>
I didn't want it to end<br>
I watched it blow in the wind<br>
I should've listened to my friends<br>
Leave this shit in the past<br>
But I want it to last<br>
You were made outta plastic (fake)<br>
I was tangled up in your drastic ways<br>
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?<br>
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes<br>
I gave you my heart and you made heart break<br>
You made my heart break<br>
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)<br>
You made my heart break<br>
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)<br>
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)<br>
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)<br>
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways)<br>
(Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?)<br>
I still see your shadows in my room<br>
