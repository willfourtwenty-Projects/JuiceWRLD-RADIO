Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip<br><br>
Crash my whip off the drugs I'm swervin'<br>
Sticks and stones may break my bones<br>
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me<br>
Ex-girlfriend keeps callin' my phone<br>
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried<br>
All alone, did it on my own<br>
So I show no mercy, I show no mercy<br>
With my bros but I got my pole<br>
Screamin', "Please don't urge me, please don't urge me, " yuh<br>
Screamin', "Please don't urge me"<br>
And fuck these hoes all they do is irk me<br>
I smoke my dope and I pop my Perky<br>
And lock my phone 'cause these hoes be lurkin', yuh<br>
Yeah, these hoes be lurkin'<br>
A bad lil' bitch with her hips so curvy<br>
I drive my whip off the drugs, I'm swervin'<br>
She ride my dick off the drugs, she swervin', woah<br>
