Ooh, ooh, woah<br><br>
I never been scared<br>
I tell you that I don't care<br>
Really I do care<br>
I hope that you care (You know it's Mitch Mula)<br>
I never been scared to love (Drop that bombaclot)<br>
I never been scared of love, scared to love<br>
I'm on the drugs, way too much<br>
I'm not enough, not enough<br>
You're way too much, way too much<br>
Not scared to love just scared of love<br>
Not enough I'm not enough<br>
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough<br>
You're way too much, still I'm not getting enough<br>
You're way too much, too, too much<br>
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much<br>
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love<br>
No, I need more drugs, way too much<br>
All I ever do is get fucked up<br>
All I ever wanted was a real love<br>
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked out<br>
Bros said that it wasn't real mud<br>
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest<br>
Lately I been feelin' the worst<br>
So I gotta dress like the best<br>
Moncler all on my chest<br>
VVS all on my neck<br>
Ballin' like a fucking upset<br>
They're beyond stressed<br>
I been hurt but I'm beyond that<br>
I never been scared of love, scared to love<br>
I'm on the drugs, way too much<br>
I'm not enough, not enough<br>
You're way too much, way too much<br>
Not scared to love just scared of love<br>
Not enough I'm not enough<br>
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough<br>
You're way too much, still not getting enough<br>
We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?<br>
As far as I can tell you're the only heaven here<br>
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options<br>
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin<br>
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay<br>
I know I been dead for a minute now<br>
Ain't wanna be alive, no way<br>
I never been scared of love, scared to love<br>
I'm on the drugs, way too much<br>
I'm not enough, not enough<br>
You're way too much, way too much<br>
Not scared to love just scared of love<br>
Not enough I'm not enough<br>
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough<br>
You're way too much, still I'm not getting enough<br>
