D- why is she so d-?<br>
She Medusa with a little Pocahontas<br>

'Cause every time that we're together, I'm unconcious<br>
Hold up, let me be honest<br>

Just another funeral for her, god-<br>

My eyes closed, hopin' this ain't make-believe<br>
And she don't know that all her demons live in me, yeah<br>
I don't know, I don't know<br>
Don't know what she been on, I don't know<br>
All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it<br>
One cup on me, don't got no friends<br>
I'm an open door, I ain't have to let her in<br>
She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine<br>
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it<br>
