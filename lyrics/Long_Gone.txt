Cardo got wings<br><br>
Now we cookin' up (yeah)<br>
Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her<br>
I kept all of her paraphernalia<br>
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser<br>
Think about the days when I used to undress her<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone<br>
Sorrow and sadness next to me<br>
Old hoes see that I'm mournin' so they textin' me<br>
Ex bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing<br>
Listen to my story, it's depressing<br>
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs not the best thing<br>
The devil tryna to test me I'm failing, inhaling<br>
You took it all back<br>
All that heartbreak, that was a year ago<br>
Wanted you back, so bad, but that's<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone<br>
What you don't seem to understand is<br>
You really took my love for granted<br>
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish<br>
Haven't been in love in a long while<br>
Wait until my next girl finds out<br>
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out<br>
Drownin' in my thoughts baby looking for a lighthouse<br>
Ain't no sleep I been feeling like a night owl<br>
Music turnt up, neighbours telling me to pipe down<br>
Oh the other hand, I think I found my future wife<br>
But she not here with me so it get lonely at night, aye<br>
I hope, her love doesn't go away<br>
I hope this ain't a phase<br>
One more heartbreak and I'll be<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone, long gone, long gone<br>
Long gone<br>
Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her<br>
I kept all of her paraphernalia<br>
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser<br>
Think about the days when I used to undress her<br>
