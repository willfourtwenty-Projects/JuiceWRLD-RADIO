This is as far as it goes<br><br>
This the end of the road<br>
This the end of the rope<br>
The other end of the throat<br>
"It's suicidal", she wrote<br>
This is the end of the show, it's over<br>
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma<br>
We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder<br>
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner<br>
I know I'm doin' drugs, but so what?<br>
Just pray to God, I never throw up<br>
I pray to God, my plug got pour up<br>
I pray to God, my plug still show up<br>
I know the last time we tried to rob him<br>
He lucky, bro'nem ain't fuckin' off him<br>
I'm drinkin', drivin' in the Bentley coupe, so<br>
It's hard for me to drive, move too slow<br>
I told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe<br>
I only save the money, anti-hero<br>
I burn my old clothes and got some new clothes<br>
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes<br>
My brother got a chopper, and it's kickin' like Judo<br>
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door<br>
This is as far as it goes<br>
This the end of the road<br>
This the end of the rope<br>
The other end of the throat<br>

This is the end of the show, it's over<br>
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma<br>
I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma<br>
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma<br>
I get so high that I'm in the clouds with the fallen angels<br>
Demons with halos<br>
She love the coke but not Coca-Cola<br>
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya<br>
Her name rings bells like a Motorola<br>
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer<br>
And she gon' ride like a rollercoaster<br>
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over<br>
But it's far from over, losing composure<br>
In a coffin, laying stiff like a boulder<br>
This is as far as it goes<br>
This the end of the road<br>
This the end of the rope<br>
The other end of the throat<br>
