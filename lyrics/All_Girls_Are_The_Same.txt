Mmm, they're rottin' my brain, love<br>
These hoes are the same<br><br>
I admit it, another ho got me finished<br>
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't<br>
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle<br>
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow<br>
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow<br>
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo<br>
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado<br>
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow<br>
Who am I kiddin'?<br>
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in<br>
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon<br>
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute<br>
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in<br>
I don't fit in<br>
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it<br>
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'<br>
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'<br>
Hey, these girls are insane<br>
Uh, all girls are the same<br>
They're rottin' my brain, love<br>
Think I need a change<br>
Before I go insane, love<br>
All girls are the same<br>
They're rottin' my brain, love<br>
Think I need a change<br>
Before I go insane, love<br>
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes<br>
To break my heart, oh no, she didn't<br>
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow<br>
Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow<br>
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind<br>
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time<br>
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?<br>
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'<br>
Ah, now I am insane<br>
Demons in my brain, love<br>
Peace I can't attain<br>
'Cause all these girls the same, love<br>
Now I am insane<br>
Demons in my brain, love<br>
Peace I can't attain<br>
'Cause all these girls the same, love<br>
