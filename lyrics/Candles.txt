don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure<br><br>
I'm not sure (yeah, I like that)<br>
Uh, yeah, I'm not sure<br>
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure<br>
Baby, you're not her<br>
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur<br>
Baby, you jump first<br>
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth<br>
Baby, do your worst<br>
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first<br>
I've been through the ringer<br>
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger<br>
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer<br>
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer<br>
I play love games, but no I'm not a cheater<br>
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner<br>
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her<br>
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?<br>
Love don't end, good for me, no good for me<br>
She's good for me, too good<br>
These hoes love playing me<br>
Heartbreaking me<br>
Don't pray for me<br>
Just give me drugs<br>
Just give me drugs<br>
Just bring me drugs<br>
Just give me drugs<br>
Yeah, I'm not sure<br>
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure<br>
Baby, you're not her<br>
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur<br>
Baby, you jump first<br>
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth<br>
Baby, do your worst<br>
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first<br>
I told her run around and get away, I think I need a getaway<br>
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play<br>
I need an umbrella 'cause every day feels like a rainy day<br>
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away<br>
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners<br>
Satan bossing me around but you know I don't take orders<br>
Yeah, I had to move around I was starting to feel cornered<br>
Starting to feel cornered, I can't see the front door<br>
Starting to feel cornered, starting to feel slaughtered<br>
Started to not give a fuck, screaming out, "why bother"<br>
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter<br>
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle<br>
I'm not sure<br>
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure<br>
Baby, you're not her<br>
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur<br>
Baby, you jump first<br>
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth<br>
Baby, do your worst<br>
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first<br>
