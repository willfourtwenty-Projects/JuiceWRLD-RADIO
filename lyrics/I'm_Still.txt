Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh<br><br>
Like oh, ooh-woah, oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
I'm holding my breath and watching my step<br>
I'm listing regrets and you made that list<br>
You're my depression<br>
Your first impression, wasn't deception<br>
You were lyin'<br>
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken<br>
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet<br>
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion<br>
I wrote my dosage, I'm getting higher<br>
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils<br>
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel<br>
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils<br>
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel<br>
Oh, ooh-woah, oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh, ooh-woah, oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
Fell in love with your face off the 'shrooms<br>
The way it animates your eyes in the room<br>
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you<br>
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof<br>
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb<br>
I'm feeling over consumed<br>
She walking me to my dorm, I see her face in my room<br>
When I'm alone in the room, I'ma blame that on the 'shrooms<br>
Oh, feeling ridiculed<br>
Feeling like a fool<br>
Don't know what to do<br>
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose<br>
I'm holding my breath and watching my step<br>
I'm listing regrets and you made that list<br>
You're my depression<br>
Your first impression, wasn't deception<br>
You were lyin'<br>
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken<br>
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet<br>
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion<br>
I wrote my dosage, I'm getting higher<br>
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils<br>
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel<br>
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils<br>
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel<br>
Oh, ooh-woah, oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh, ooh-woah, oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
